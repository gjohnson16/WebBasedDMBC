Comp Bio project:
Inputs: training data set and test data set of relative abundances
From dmbc_predict.r :
@param data Validation dataset with rows are samples, columns are features. The first column should be the sample ID, second column group variable (Disease type, the label you want to classify on).
#' @param testSet Lable unknown testSet without sample IDs.
#' @param auc_out Output object of Cal_AUC() from a validation set.
#' @param col_start An index indicating at which column is the beginning of bacteria (features) data in the validation set. The default is the 3rd column.
#' @param type_col An index indicating at which column is group/type variable in the validation set. The default is the 2nd column.
#' @param Prior1 Prevalence of label1 according to literature or experience. Default is 0.5.
#' @param Prior2 Prevalence of label2 according to literature or experience. Default is 0.5.
From loocv.r:
@param data A data frame validation set with first column the sample IDs, second column the group variable (classificatoin variable/disease type), and third column the beginning of count table.
#' @param type_col An index indicating at which column is group/type variable. The default is the 3rd column.
#' @param col_start An index indicating at which column is the beginning of bacteria (features) data. Default is the 2nd column.
#' @param Cutoff_mean The minimum average relative abundance allowed in filtering step. Default is 0.0005.
#' @param Cutoff_ratio The non-zero ratio cutoff in filtering features.Default value is 0.1.
#' @param totalReadsCutoff The minimum allowed total reads per sample. Any sample has less than this number of total reads will be removed. Default is 500.
#' @param Cutoff_pvalue The maximal P value allowed for a given feature to be remained in the list of selected features.
From best_com.r:
@param CV Output object from loocv().
#' @param auc_out Output object form Cal_AUC()
From FS.r:
@param training A data frame of training set.
#' @param type_col An index indicating at which column is group/type variable. The default is the 3rd column.
#' @param col_start An index indicating at which column is the beginning of bacteria (features) data. Default is the 2nd column.
#' @param Cutoff_mean The minimum average relative abundance allowed in filtering step. Default is 0.0005.
#' @param Cutoff_ratio The non-zero ratio cutoff in filtering features.Default value is 0.1.
#' @param totalReadsCutoff The minimum allowed total reads per sample. Any sample has less than this number of total reads will be removed. Default is 500.
#' @param Cutoff_pvalue The maximum Pvalue allowed for a givien feature to be remained on the list of the selected features.
From CalProb.r
@param FS_out An object from the FeatureSelection()
#' @param testSet A test set in data frame or matrix form. The colnames should have the same bacteria (features) as in the training set.
#' @param col_start An index indicating at which column is the beginning of bacteria (features) data. The default is the 3rd column.
#' @param type_col An index indicating at which column is group/type variable. The default is the 2nd column.
#' @param HighestRank The top number of features inclueded in model. The default is all the features left after filtering.
To do:
-	Go through and decide user inputs
-	Lay out exact questions for our meeting with Dr Dong
-	Fully set up our git hub and everyone does an initial push from the cox machine
-	Set up the initial webpage in flask
-	Delegate roles

Additional notes from nick (3/25):
	-pictures sent in group chat via text
	- need to set up an authentification system
	-need to set up a database to house all user data as well as job data and protect things
if there is a crash int he server
	-there is a jobID associated with the training data that get entered when the user 
uploads the real test data, 
	-depending on job status, we are running test or training data
	-additional websites from nick were posted on the google drive/ sent via email to group members
